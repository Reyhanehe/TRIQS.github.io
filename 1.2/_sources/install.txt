Installation 
============

TRIQS and its applications are provided *Ã  la carte*: 
after you have installed the TRIQS library, you will be able to easily install 
various TRIQS-based applications: impurity solvers, realistic DMFT tools, ...

This page describes the installation of the TRIQS library itself. The
installation procedure of the applications is described on their respective
sites, under 'Install'.

Prerequisites
-------------

The TRIQS library relies on a certain number of standard libraries and tools
described in the :ref:`list of requirements <requirements>`. Please pay
particular attention to the :ref:`C++ compilers<require_cxx_compilers>` and to
:ref:`Python and the scientific python tools<python_install>`.  Here are instructions to
install these necessary libraries on two standard systems:

   installation/ubuntu
   installation/osx_install

.. note:: Please ensure that you have all the dependencies installed before proceeding further!

Installation steps
------------------

#. Download the sources of TRIQS from github into a ``src`` directory::

     $ git clone https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs.git src

#. Create an empty ``build`` directory where you will compile the code::

     $ mkdir build && cd build

#. In the build directory call ``cmake`` specifying where the TRIQS library should be installed::

     $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_install_directory ../src

   If you omit ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, the default
   ``path_to_install_directory`` is the subdirectory *INSTALL_DIR* in your build
   directory. More configuration options are described in the
   :ref:`cmake options <install_options>`.

#. Compile the code, run the tests and install the library::

     $ make
     $ make test
     $ make install

   .. note:: 
       
      On multicore machine, the make option -jN (where N is the number of cores)
      greatly speeds up the compilation, e.g. make -j8 on an 8 core machine.

#. After the installation TRIQS has been installed using the standard UNIX
   scheme:

   * executables in ``path_to_install_directory/bin``.

   * c++ and python libraries in ``path_to_install_directory/lib``.

   * c++ headers in ``path_to_install_directory/include/triqs``.
 
   * shared items (e.g. the documentation) in ``path_to_install_directory/share/triqs``.

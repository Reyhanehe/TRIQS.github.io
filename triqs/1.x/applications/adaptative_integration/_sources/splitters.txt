Splitters
=========

1d
--

There is only one sort of one-dimensional splitter : it splits a given
segment :math:`[a,b]` into two segments of equal length
:math:`[a,\frac{a+b}{2}]` and :math:`[\frac{a+b}{2}, b]`

2d
--

There are two types of splitters:

Barycentric splitter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It splits a triangle into three triangles with the help of the
barycenter of the original triangle

Orthogonal splitter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It splits a triangle into two rectangle triangles with the help of the
foot of the height going to the hypotenuse.

3d
--

We have implemented only a barycentric splitter (which is the
generalization of the 2d barycentric splitter to the 3d case)

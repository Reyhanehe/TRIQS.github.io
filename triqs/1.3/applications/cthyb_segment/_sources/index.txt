The hybridization-expansion segment solver
==========================================

The :ref:`TRIQS-based <triqslibs:welcome>` hybridization-expansion segment
solver allows to solve the problem of a **quantum impurity** embedded in a
conduction bath. It is restricted to **purely density-density interaction** 
vertices, but is very much optimized for this situation. Moreover, these interactions may be **dynamical**.

The "impurity" can be any set of orbitals, on one or several atoms. To be more specific, the Hamiltonian of the problem has the form:

.. math::

         \mathcal{H} = \sum_{k,\alpha} \epsilon_{k,\alpha} c^\dagger_{k,\alpha} c_{k,\alpha} + \sum_{k,\alpha}
              V_{k,\alpha} ( c^\dagger_{k,\alpha} d_{\alpha} + h.c. ) +
                            \mu \sum_\alpha d^\dagger_\alpha d_\alpha +
                                       \frac{1}{2}   \sum_{\alpha\beta} U_{\alpha\beta} n_{\alpha} n_{\beta}.

Here the operators :math:`c^{\dagger}` create a fermion in the bath, while the operators :math:`d^{\dagger}` create a fermion on the impurity. In this problem, the hybridization function :math:`\Delta` between the bath and the impurity is given by:

.. math::

     \Delta_{\alpha} (i \omega_n) = \sum_k \frac{V_{k,\alpha} V^*_{k,\alpha}}{i \omega_n - \epsilon_{k,\alpha}},

so that the non-interacting Green's function of the impurity is:

.. math::

  \hat{\mathcal{G}}^{-1}_0 (i \omega_n) = i \omega_n + \mu - \hat{\Delta}(i \omega_n).



With the knowledge of :math:`\mathcal{G}_0` and the matrix :math:`U_{\alpha\beta}`, the quantum impurity solvers find the interacting Green's function :math:`G` of the problem.

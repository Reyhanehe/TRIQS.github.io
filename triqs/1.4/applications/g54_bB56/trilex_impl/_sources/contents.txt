Reference documentation
=========================

This repository contains functions pertaining to the local vertex :math:`\Lambda^\eta_{uv\alpha}(i\omega,i\Omega)`.

There are three main groups of functions:
 - **"lattice" functions** which comprise the calculation of the main TRILEX formulae :math:`\Sigma(k) \sim \lambda G(k+q) W(q) \Lambda` (:ref:`sigma_gwl`) and :math:`P(q) \sim \lambda G(k+q)G(k) \Lambda` (:ref:`p_ggl`); the computation of the :math:`\zeta` factor is also implemented here (:ref:`compute_zeta`)
 - **"local" functions** which comprise the calculation of the vertex starting from the full three-point correlation function (and the legs, :ref:`compute_Lambda`), as well as the implementation of the exact formulae :math:`\Sigma \sim \lambda G W \Lambda` (:ref:`sigma_gwl`) and :math:`P \sim \lambda GG \Lambda` (:ref:`p_ggl`) at the local level. These functions are generic (can be used beyond single-band, single-site, normal-state TRILEX)
 - functions **specific** to single-site TRILEX applied to the Hubbard model (:ref:`compute_Lambda_single_band_Hubbard`, :ref:`evaluate_vertex`)...

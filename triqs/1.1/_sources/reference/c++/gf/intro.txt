Introduction
=================

The `gf` container and its views `gf_view` and `gf_const_view` allows to store and manipulate
various Green functions, on various meshes, e.g. : 

* Matsubara frequency(ies),
* Matsubara time(s),
* real time(s),
* real frequency(ies),
* Legendre representation.
* Block of other green functions.
* Cartesian product of green functions.

Various free functions are also provided to handle transformations between various representation of a Green function, 
such as Fourier transforms.

This section is organized as follows :

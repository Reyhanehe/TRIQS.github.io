Reference documentation
=========================

The 'cthyb-segment' solver is a continuous-time Quantum Monte Carlo solver aimed at solving an :doc:`Anderson impurity model <definitions>` with static and dynamical density-density interactions.

Below is a very short example demonstrating the basic usage of the solver.

.. runblock:: python

  from pytriqs.gf.local import *
  from pytriqs.operators import *

  # set up a few parameters
  U = 2.0
  beta = 20.0
  mu = 0.2
  eps0 = 0.3
  V = 1.0

  # Construct the segment solver
  from cthyb_segment_offdiag import Solver
  S = Solver(beta = beta, gf_struct = {"up":[0],"down":[0]})

  # initialize the Green function
  S.G0_iw << inverse(iOmega_n + mu - V**2 * inverse(iOmega_n - eps0))

  S.solve(h_int = U * n('up',0)*n('down',0),
          n_cycles  = 10000,
          length_cycle = 100,
          n_warmup_cycles = 5000,
          measure_nn = False,
          move_move = False,
          move_swap_empty_lines = False)


To use the solver, one has to go through the following steps:

Import the Solver class::

  from cthyb_segment_offdiag import Solver 
 
Declare and construct a solver instance. Some construction parameters are mandatory, some others are optional. See :doc:`here <options>` for a complete list.::

  S = Solver(beta = beta, gf_struct = {"up":[0],"down":[0]})
 
Initialize the inputs of the solver. For a complete list of the input and output members of the solver, see :doc:`here <members>` ::

  S.G0_iw <<= inverse(iOmega_n + mu - V**2 * inverse(iOmega_n - eps0))
 
  
Call the solve() method. This method comes with mandatory and optional parameters, whose complete list can be found :doc:`here <options>`.::

  S.solve(h_int = U * n('up',0)*n('down',0),
          n_cycles  = 100000,
          length_cycle = 100,
          n_warmup_cycles = 5000,
          measure_nn = False,
          move_move = False,
          move_swap_empty_lines = False)

Reporting issues
================

Please report all problems and bugs directly at the bitbucket issue page
`<https://bitbucket.org/tayral/cthyb_segment_offdiag/issues>`_.  In order to make it
easier for us to solve your problem please follow these guidelines:

#. In all cases specify which **version** of the application you are using. See :doc:`here <provenance>` to know how to extract the hash of the git commit you are using.

#. If you have a problem during the installation, give us information about
   your operating system and the compiler you are using. Include the outputs of
   the ``cmake`` and ``make`` commands as well as the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file
   which is in the build directory. Please include these outputs in a 
   `gist <http://gist.github.com/>`_ file referenced in the issue.

#. If you are experiencing a problem during the execution of the application, provide
   a script which allows to quickly reproduce the problem.

Thanks!

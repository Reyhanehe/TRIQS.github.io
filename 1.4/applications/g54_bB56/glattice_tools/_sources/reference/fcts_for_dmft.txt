Functions for DMFT
=========================

To perform DMFT (or beyond) calculations, several functions are used recurrently :

  * Dyson equations for fermionic and bosonic Green's functions (starting from the self-energies and bare interactions/dispersions...)

  * computation of the filling

  * determination of the chemical potential corresponding to a filling

You can access the documentation of these functions by clicking the links below:

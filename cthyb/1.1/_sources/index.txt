The hybridization-expansion solver
==================================

The :ref:`TRIQS-based <triqslibs:welcome>` hybridization-expansion
solver allows to solve the generic problem of a quantum impurity embedded in a
conduction bath. The local interaction vertex can have any structure.

Learn how to use it in the :ref:`documentation`.

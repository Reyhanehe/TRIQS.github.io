dmftproj
--------

The dft_tools package comes with a converter to use `Wien2k <http://www.wien2k.at>`_ band structure calculations as input for the DMFT part of the calculation, through the construction of projective Wannier functions. The first step is done by the program :program:`dmftproj`, producing text output files. In the second step, this ouput is read and converted into the hdf5 format, using the python module :class:`Wien2kConverter`.

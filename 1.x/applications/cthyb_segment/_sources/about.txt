The continuous-time hybridization-expansion segment solver has been written by
T. Ayral, H. Hafermann, M. Ferrero and O. Parcollet. It is based on
a hybridization expansion of the partition function as described in references
[#ctqmc1]_ and [#ctqmc2]_. The computation of the imaginary-time Greenâ€™s
function has been improved with the use of Legendre polynomials following
reference [#ctqmc3]_.
